# Hamiltonian Truncation

This python code can be used to quickly generate the truncated Hamiltonian for 2d \phi^4 theory. The interacting Hamiltonian matrix in a basis truncated at ~10^6 states can be generated on O(days) using this code with modest computational resources (for example, a laptop). See the accompanying work arXiv:2109.XXXX.
